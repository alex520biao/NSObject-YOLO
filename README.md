## NSObject+YOLO

Using method swizzling to add behaviour to existing methods is a very
powerful technique in Objective-C. However, it is pretty verbose and
repetitive to use in production code. This helper category aims to
provide a much simpler, block-based way of mixing your own code into
existing methods.
